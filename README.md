# Amazon Sales 2025 – Exploratory Data Analysis

This project showcases an end-to-end Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a fictional Amazon Sales dataset for the year 2025. It highlights my ability to clean, analyze, visualize, and generate insights from real-world-style retail data using Python and Matplotlib.


##  Objectives
- Clean and prepare raw sales data for analysis
- Explore sales trends by product, category, and time
- Visualize business insights to aid decision-making
- Build an EDA portfolio project to demonstrate data analysis skills


## Tools Used
- **Python**  
- **Pandas** – for data manipulation and summarization  
- **Matplotlib** – for creating visualizations  
- **Jupyter Notebook**


## Key Insights

- **Electronics** had the highest total revenue (€129,950), while **Home Appliances** had the highest average sales per item (€2,625).
- Top-selling products included **Refrigerators**, **Laptops**, and **Smartphones**.
- **February and March** were peak sales months, showing potential seasonal trends.
- **PayPal** was the most used payment method among customers.
- Average quantity per order was highest for **Electronics**, **Clothing**, and **Books**.
